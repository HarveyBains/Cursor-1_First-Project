- I wishing to create a web app for noting my dreams and any useful ideas that I might want to journal. I would like you to create a design plan: Design-Plan.md

- The SRC folder contains all my source files from a web project that I made using figma.make. I would like to be able to recreate this as a new web project.


- Source 1: src/figma-make-project/TECHNICAL-FEATURE-DOCUMENTATION-v13.0.0.md. This file contains the PRD for the entire project and lists all the features. Please use this fully in the plan.


- Source 2: These files show how the project must look like. Whenever creating a new UI element, please refer to these screenshots for theme, styling, colors, and even fonts. Please confirm in the plan that you can see these files.Even put commit this to your memory.
    src/figma-make-project/Screenshot-1 Home-Page.png, 
    src/figma-make-project/Screenshot-2 Edit-Form.png. 


- Source 3: In the source file there is the app.tsx but because it's so large I've split it up into those four sub files above. Please read these app sub files as they contain all the logic that has been proven to be working. So I would like this to be as a source for the logic going forward. Please confirm in the plan that you can see these files.

    /Users/harvey/Documents/Cursor/Project-2-Claude-Setup/src/figma-make-project/App-1k-to-2k-lines.tsx
    /Users/harvey/Documents/Cursor/Project-2-Claude-Setup/src/figma-make-project/App-2kto3k-lines.tsx
    /Users/harvey/Documents/Cursor/Project-2-Claude-Setup/src/figma-make-project/App-3kPlus-lines.tsx


- Other Source files: There are many more files in the source subfolder. Please try to make use of all of them.

- For styling use a stable version of Tailwind

- Every time a new webu UI element is created, I would like to be asked to inspect it before proceeding to the next.

- Do the Firebase database and Google remote authentication at the end.

- This project must be deployable via Netlify.

- Create a step-by-step plan. And sequence it so that the graphical setup and user interface is done at a starting phase. Then do the coding as subsequent phases.

- In your plan also prompt me to do a git push at stages that you think would be worthwhile.

- In your plan also suggest if the AI context memory needs to be cleared because some AI memories are limited and I want the AI to be focused and not hallucinate. Have you read all the source files? So are you ready to start creating my design plan?
