# Dream-Notions App â€“ Project Progress & Roadmap

## âœ… Migration & Modernization Status
- **shadcn/ui migration:** 100% complete (all UI components migrated)
- **Legacy/Redundant UI:** No legacy UI remains; all dialogs, panels, and controls use shadcn/ui
- **Codebase audit:** Ongoing (see below for redundant logic cleanup)

---

## ðŸ§¹ Redundant Logic & Simplification
- [ ] Review and remove any unused imports, state variables, or handlers in `App.tsx`
- [ ] Remove any unused components or files in `src/components`, `src/utils`, or `src/hooks`
- [ ] Clean up any leftover props, handlers, or code from previous UI systems
- [ ] Confirm all dialogs and panels are only rendered once and controlled by a single state
- [ ] Remove any commented-out or dead code

---

## ðŸ“‹ Completed Tasks
- shadcn/ui migration (all phases)
- Debug panel refactor and simplification
- Welcome/empty state onboarding (added and then reverted per user request)
- All dialogs, forms, and controls modernized
- Codebase reviewed for shadcn/ui compliance

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Final pass to remove any redundant logic (see above)
- [ ] Confirm all state and props are necessary and used
- [ ] Review for any unused files or utilities
- [ ] Finalize documentation and onboarding for new contributors

---

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming / Future Improvements
- Improved mobile experience and responsive tweaks
