02/07/25 - SA Submission  Approved, Tags: The-Unknown/Message, ⭐
I just spent the morning doing the gardening so I was a bit tired and so the opportunity came to have some rest so I went upstairs to have a meditation.
I knew I needed to do my self assessment submission form today, so I decided that perhaps I should do meditation and ask the question should I submit my completed SA form 
I listened to Shinzen meditation, did some breath sessions,  and got nice and restful but not enough to nod-off. 
After about 40 minutes this idea came 
That the owed tax on the SA form for about £2k  could be paid from my safe box that I'd forgotten about that 
So I thought this was a good idea; and then moreover I reflected that perhaps this good- idea was a response to my original question about whether I should submit the SA form.
