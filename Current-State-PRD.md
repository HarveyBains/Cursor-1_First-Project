# Product Requirements Document: Dream-Notions Web App (Current State)

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the current implemented features and functionalities of the Dream-Notions web application as of its current development state. It serves as a snapshot for understanding the existing capabilities and as a reference for future development or regeneration.

## 2. Technical Stack (Current)

-   **Frontend:** React (with Vite) and TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3.3.3 (stable version)
-   **Local Storage:** For data persistence

## 3. Implemented Features

### 3.1 Core Application Setup

-   **Project Initialization:** The application is set up using Vite with React and TypeScript.
-   **Styling Integration:** Tailwind CSS (version 3.3.3) is integrated and configured for styling.
-   **Directory Structure:** Basic project directories (`src/components`, `src/services`, `src/hooks`, `src/types`, `src/styles`, `src/utils`) are established.

### 3.2 Theming & UI Elements

-   **Default Dark Theme:** The application defaults to a dark theme upon loading, with a color palette inspired by Obsidian (dark grey backgrounds, vibrant purple accents for primary elements, and neutral greys for text and borders).
-   **Header Component:**
    -   Displays the application title ("Dream-Notions") and version (`v13.0.2`).
    -   Includes placeholder icons for a theme toggle (moon icon), a List Planner (notepad icon), and a Sign In button (Google icon).
    -   The header background is a neutral dark grey, and text elements are appropriately colored for contrast.
-   **Control Panel:**
    -   A static section below the header containing three buttons: "Export", "Import", and "Add Notion".
    -   Buttons are styled with primary purple accents and appropriate icons.
-   **Filter & Sort Controls:**
    -   A static section containing buttons for filtering by "Recents" and "Favorites", and a three-state sort toggle ("Manual").
    -   Buttons display placeholder counts (e.g., "0").

### 3.3 Data Management & Display

-   **DreamEntry Interface:** A TypeScript interface (`src/types/DreamEntry.ts`) is defined to structure dream data.
-   **Markdown Import Functionality:**
    -   The `parseImportMarkdown` utility (`src/utils/importExportUtils.ts`) is implemented to parse dream data from a specific markdown format (as provided in `Data-Export.md`).
    -   An "Import" dialog (`src/components/ImportDialog.tsx`) is present, allowing users to paste markdown content for import.
-   **Dynamic Dream List Display:**
    -   The `App.tsx` component dynamically renders `DreamItem` components based on the `dreams` state.
    -   `DreamItem` component (`src/components/DreamItem.tsx`) displays the dream title, tags, and description.
    -   Visual rendering of `DreamItem` ensures full dream titles are visible and the first line of the description is displayed.
-   **Local Data Persistence:**
    -   Dream data is persisted using `localStorage` (`src/utils/localStorageUtils.ts`).
    -   Data is loaded from `localStorage` on application startup.
    -   Any changes to the `dreams` state (e.g., via import) are automatically saved to `localStorage`.
    -   Data persists across browser sessions and application restarts.

## 4. Outstanding Features / Next Steps

-   Full implementation of theme toggle functionality.
-   Implementation of user authentication (Firebase).
-   Integration with Firestore for cloud data synchronization.
-   Full implementation of CRUD operations for dreams (Add, Edit, Delete) with UI interaction.
-   Implementation of advanced filtering, sorting, and search functionalities.
-   Implementation of the List Planner feature.
-   Implementation of the Export functionality.
-   Mobile responsiveness and touch optimizations.
-   Performance optimizations beyond initial setup.

This PRD will be updated as new features are implemented and existing ones are refined.
